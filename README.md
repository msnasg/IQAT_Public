## 🚀 Overview
No one gets into trading thinking it will be easy. I certainly didn't when I started more than a decade ago.
What surprised me most was how much external noise, emotions, bias, and even a CEO's tweet could cloud my analysis and hurt consistency.
After years of frustration with manual analysis and unreliable tools, in 2017 while studying in Milan, I started building a better system—one that combines quantitative methods, automation, and intuitive dashboards.
Today, this system has evolved into IQAT — a platform designed to empower analysts and traders with meaningful insights.
I started IQAT to bridge the gap between professional-grade tools and accessibility for everyday traders. Since then, it has grown into a robust platform, constantly evolving with new features and custom tools.
