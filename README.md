Integrated Quantitative Analytical Tools (IQAT)

No one gets into trading thinking it will be easy. I certainly didn't when I started trading, more than a decade ago. What surprised me was how much external factors, emotions, bias, a Silicon Valley CEO's tweets, ..., tended to play into my analyses, keeping me from finding a consistent strategy. Like many others, I have spent way too much time manually crunching charts, only to start from scratch the next day. Not only is this time-consuming, it often interferes with the end goal: consistently profitable trades. In 2017, after several years trading, while studying at the university of Milan, I was fed up with these inefficiencies and the substandard results all available tools produced. I set out to build a new type of quantitative analysis platform, one that would give me the tools to build better plans while helping to mitigate profit-killing blunders by making analysis more consistent. Today, this platform has evolved into the most comprehensive analysis software on the market and I continue to innovate.

## My Story
My name is Mohsen Asgari. I'm an independent financial data analysts and beside software developer.
I've been in Financial markets as an analyst and trader for over 10 years and creating software professionally about 5 years. I am passionate about making useful tools for real people and companies. Several years ago I went looking for software to help me with my investments, but couldn't find anything for the average investor like myself. Everything that I found was either very expensive, not easy to use, or designed only for professionals. So I decided to build my own, making it simple and affordable, so that others could benefit too. There you go, IQAT was born. The solutions have come a long way since its initial release. It continues to grow, with new features added regularly.
